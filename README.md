## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

**Hariharvenkata/hariharvenkata** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Hi everyone,

Iâ€™m thrilled to join GitHub as the Director of Corporate Sales in India! Being new here, Iâ€™m looking forward to connecting with as many of you as possibleâ€”donâ€™t hesitate to reach out or grab some time to chat.

Outside of work, Iâ€™ve recently picked up golf and you can usually find me on the course over the weekends. When not golfing, I aim to hit the gym at least four times a week and enjoy spending time outdoors.

Fun fact: I have a gold medal from the National Karate Championships (yes, I can kick pretty high!) and at one point, I seriously considered pursuing a career in poker.

I live in Bangalore with my wife, and my pronouns are he/him. Excited to collaborate and contribute to GitHubâ€™s amazing journey!
